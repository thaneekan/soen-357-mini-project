## Understanding the problem

In today's rapidly aging society, mental health challenges among the elderly have emerged as a silent epidemic that often goes unnoticed and untreated. As we strive to enhance the quality of life for our aging population, it becomes imperative to address the unique psychological needs and barriers they face. Isolation, loss of independence, and the transition into retirement or care facilities can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, significantly impacting their overall well-being. Recognizing these issues is the first step in developing targeted interventions. Several technological strides have been made in the mental health industry, but none have been catered towards the elderly and their potential issues. 

Our goal is to bridge this gap by creating a mental health and wellbeing application for the elderly. 

## Research
The idea of a mental health app isn't new; applications have been created without a specifically targeted audience. Here are some examples:

### Calm

Description:

Meditation and mindfulness app aimed at reducing stress, improving sleep, and enhancing overall mental health through guided meditations, sleep stories, and relaxation music. It caters to a broad audience with content designed for both meditation novices and experienced practitioners, offering a variety of session lengths to fit different schedules.


Drawbacks:

Full range of Calm's content is locked behind a subscription fee, which may be a barrier for users seeking free resources. Additionally, some users may find the app's content selection overwhelming when first starting their mindfulness journey. 



### BetterHelp

Description:

Online counseling and therapy service providing access to licensed therapists via text, voice, or video sessions. It offers personalized matchmaking with therapists based on the user's specific needs and preferences, aiming to make mental health support accessible and convenient.

Drawbacks:

One potential drawback is the cost, as BetterHelp operates on a subscription model that may be expensive for some users without insurance coverage. Additionally, the nature of online therapy may not suit everyone, especially those who prefer the nuances of face-to-face interaction or have more complex mental health needs.


### Headspace

Description:

Meditation and mindfulness app designed to help users manage stress, sleep better, and improve their overall mental well-being through guided meditations, sleep sounds, and mindfulness exercises. The app is tailored to suit both beginners and those with a more advanced practice, offering sessions of various lengths to integrate mindfulness into any lifestyle.

Drawbacks:

Most of its features require a subscription, which might deter individuals looking for free mental health resources. Additionally, some users may find the app's approach to meditation and mindfulness too structured or prefer a more personalized interaction with a live instructor.







### Happify

Description:

Self-improvement app designed to boost users' happiness and emotional well-being through science-based games, activities, and exercises. It utilizes techniques from positive psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness to help users tackle stress, build resilience, and improve their overall mental health.

Drawbacks:
The gamified approach to mental wellness might not resonate with everyone, as some may prefer traditional therapy methods or more direct forms of mindfulness practice.



## Survey
To get a better understand of what features this app should have, we conducted a survey on our target demographic. Here are the questions and their results:

 
 
We started off with basic questions to get a more accurate understanding of our demographic.
 
Living situation plays a major role in how mentally stable a person can be. Unfortunately, a lot of elderly people do not live with their significant others or their families. This question, paired with the one below, helps us find a connection between their living situation and their mental state.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What would you like to see from an application to make it accessible to your generation?

We received several responses, however the most common demands we saw weâ€™re related to voiceovers, big fonts and easy to use UI. Since older generations are less familiar with technology, they would like an easy app to use. Furthermore, some other responses include features such as cognitive games, fitness plans, and computer migration.
 
 
## Analysis
After processing the results of our survey, we can illustrate potential users of our application, their lifestyles, situations, relationships, and motivations.
